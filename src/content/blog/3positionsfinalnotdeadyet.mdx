The ISSF’s decision to move towards a standing-only 3P final for LA28 has shaken the shooting community. After today’s first test of an alternative format, all eyes are on the second trial with ISSF leadership on September 12.

## The Announcement That Shook Smallbore

In June, the ISSF announced that the **50m rifle 3 positions final for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics** would only include standing. The final would be shot in the same **24-shot format as the air rifle events** (see my [previous post](../new3x20final)).  

This decision sparked immediate concern among athletes worldwide.  

## The Petition: Voices of Tradition and Integrity  

Czech shooter **Jiri Privratsky** launched a petition titled *“Include all the positions in 50m rifle final for 2028 Olympics”*. It quickly gained over **1,400 athlete signatures** [here](https://chng.it/LKDcsbzghc).  

The petition makes several powerful points:  

- Rifle shooting has been part of the Olympic tradition for **over a century**. Keeping all three positions protects not only fairness but also the integrity of a sport that embodies both physical precision and immense mental discipline.  
- Each position demands unique skills: **standing** tests balance and stability, **kneeling** requires core strength and flexibility, while **prone** emphasizes refined precision and control. Removing any of them diminishes the diversity of the sport and the value of athletes’ rigorous training.  
- Far from being boring, position changes can be **exciting for spectators** when explained well by commentators—showcasing adaptability under pressure.  
- The **sling positions** (kneeling and prone) are what truly set **50m smallbore apart from 10m air rifle**. Without them, smallbore risks being seen as “just air rifle at a longer distance.”  

## ISSF Opens the Door (Slightly)

The petition had enough impact to convince the **ISSF Council** to let the **Athletes Committee** propose an alternative. The challenge: design a format that **includes all three positions** while fitting within the **30–35 minute timeframe demanded by the IOC**.  

At the World Cup in Ningbo, **Committee Chairman Cassio Rippel** invited athletes to a meeting on **September 10th** in the finals hall to brainstorm and test new formats.  

## The First Test: September 10  

Today, the first trial was conducted with eight volunteer athletes:  

- Franziska Stark (SUI)  
- Helena Arias Casals (ESP)  
- Jiri Privratsky (CZE)  
- Aleksi Leppä (FIN)  
- Katerina Stefankova (CZE)  
- Nadine Ungerank (AUT)  
- Eduardo Sampio Gonclaves (BRA)  
- Agathe Girard (FRA)  

I had the chance to moderate the final together with **Mary Tucker**. The “imaginary gold” went to **Aleksi**, followed by **Jiri** and **Nadine**.  

The tested format resembled a **3x10 shot program** with shortened changeovers:  
- 10 shots kneeling (4:30 minutes)  
- 10 shots prone (4:00 minutes)  
- 5 shots standing with 5 single shots with the eliminations like previously

## Athlete Feedback  

Afterwards, athletes and coaches discussed openly. Key points included:  

- **10-shot blocks were too hard to follow** for spectators and commentators due to differing shooting paces.  
- The **7-minute changeover to standing** was considered too short.  
- Starting **eliminations after the first 5 standing shots** was seen as unfair to strong sling-position shooters.  
- **Peter Gorsa** voiced concerns about practical implementation for clubs and federations and favored a standing-only format, though this idea didn’t gain much support.  
- Equipment costs could rise if shooters needed **three sets of sights** to adapt to the fast transitions.  

## The Adjusted Proposal for September 12  

Taking this feedback into account, athletes agreed on a refined version to be tested on **September 12**, after the women’s 3P final, this time with ISSF President **Luciano Rossi** and other officials expected to attend:  

- 5 minutes sighting (kneeling) 
- 2×5 shots kneeling (2:30 each)  
- 5 minutes changeover
- 2×5 shots prone (2:00 each)  
- 7 minutes changeover
- 2×5 shots standing (4:10 each)  
- Eliminations from places 8–4  
- Three single shots (50s each), with one athlete eliminated after each  

If there is leftover time compared to the IOC’s 35-minute cap, it will be added to the **standing changeover**.  

As **John Leighton-Dyson** (FIN coach & ISSF Academy Head of Training) wisely remarked:  

> “Whatever format we produce now will determine the future of this sport. One wrong decision, and the next generations will not get to shoot the three positions format. So now we need to be careful and make the right steps.”  

## What’s Next  

The result of the **September 12 test** will be crucial. The final proposal will then be submitted to the ISSF Council. Its decision will ultimately shape the **future of smallbore 3P at the Olympic level**.  

I’ll keep you updated as soon as we know more.
