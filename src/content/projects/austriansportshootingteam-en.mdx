**Status:** Voluntary  
**Started:** March 2024  
**Focus:** Social Media & Photography  
**Platforms:** <a href="https://www.instagram.com/austrian.sportshooting.team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> · <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Austrian-Sport-Shooting-Team-100063777090860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>

## Initial Situation

The Austrian Shooting Federation (ÖSB) maintains a website with regular competition updates but had no official presence on social media. Anyone seeking information had to actively visit the website. The desire for an Instagram or Facebook presence had existed for years - but repeatedly failed due to budget limitations and the challenge of representing all disciplines equally.

An unofficial Facebook account under the name “Austrian Sport Shooting Team” did exist, but it was barely maintained. After the successful 2024 European Championship, I volunteered to take over the project.

## Implementation

I took over the existing Facebook page, set up a new Instagram and Meta Business account, and created a custom Canva template along with a cloud-based image workflow. In coordination with the athletes, we decided which competition results would be shared.

As a launch campaign, we organized a giveaway in cooperation with **Trainingsbuddy**: the prize was a training session with **Martin Strempfl** and **Bernhard Pickl** - a format that generated high reach and engagement.

In preparation for the 2024 Olympic Games, I updated the template and collaborated with **Team Austria** (Olympic team). Starting with the 2024/25 season, I also began designing schedules, final announcements, and a team logo. I regularly attend competitions to take photos, which can be used by the ÖSB and athletes free of charge.
