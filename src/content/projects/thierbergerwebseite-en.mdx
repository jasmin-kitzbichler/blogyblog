### Initial Situation

Until now, the Thierberger Schützen had only maintained Facebook and Instagram accounts (both managed by me, see related project), but no official website. The aim was to create a central platform for basic information - such as club structure, board members, and contact details.

### Requirements

The website was intended to have minimal ongoing costs, require little maintenance, and not need regular content updates (as those already happen on social media).  
The club specifically requested an event calendar and an easy way for board members to make content changes.

### Implementation

Instead of using a traditional CMS like WordPress, I opted for a custom-built solution using SvelteKit, hosted via Vercel - mainly to reduce maintenance needs.

To display current content, I integrated a **social wall** that automatically pulls posts from Instagram.

Additionally, I created a Google Calendar and embedded it on the site. The board was given access to the calendar to independently manage and update upcoming events.

Finally, I set up the domain and hosting. The only ongoing expense is around €20 per year for the domain license.
