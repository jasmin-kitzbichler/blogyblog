          Here’s an overview of how I can support you or your project – from the first idea to a finished digital presence.
          Whether it’s about content, design, or strategic thinking: I bring not just skills, but also experience, passion,
          and a sharp eye for detail.

            <h2>🧠 Concept & Strategy</h2>
            <p>I like to think projects backwards – with audience, purpose, and style in mind. I’ll help you bring structure to your ideas, find pragmatic solutions, and develop creative content that works.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>🖥️ UX/UI Design</h2>
            <p>User-centered design for websites, portfolios, or small web apps – always focused on clarity, recognition, and technical feasibility. I love well-thought-out systems that also make visual sense.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>🛠️ Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>I build modern websites using Astro, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. My priorities are performance, accessibility, and maintainability – whether it’s a portfolio, club website, or something in between. Markdown and CMS integration? Absolutely.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>📱 Content Creation</h2>
            <p>Whether it’s Instagram Reels, event photography, or value-driven captions – I create content with heart, style, and a deep understanding of the target audience. My strengths lie especially in the world of sports, shooting, and club communication.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>🏆 Expertise from Competitive Sports</h2>
            <p>As an active sports shooter with national and international competition experience, I understand the dynamics of training processes, goal setting, and mental strength. I know what athletes need – and what it takes to deliver consistent performance.</p>
            <p><strong>🎯 ISSF D-Trainer Course:</strong> I'm currently completing the official ISSF coaching certification, focusing on technique instruction, training planning, analysis, and pedagogical competence in shooting sports.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>🎓 Academic Background</h2>
            <p>I'm currently studying Political Science at FernUni Hagen, focusing on governance, power structures, and state development. My approach is analytical, interdisciplinary, and practice-oriented – especially at the intersection of societal change, technology, and organizations.</p>
            <p>Before that, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at FH Kufstein. The study program <em>Web Business & Technology</em> gave me a solid foundation in software development, web technologies, and digital strategy – a perfect complement to my creative work and political interests.</p>
